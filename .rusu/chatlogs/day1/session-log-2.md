# Session Log: Day 2 - Configuration Refinement and Troubleshooting

## Objective
The primary goal of this session was to investigate and resolve new warnings related to the TanStack Router Vite plugin configuration. We aimed to ensure the project aligns perfectly with the latest best practices documented by both the library authors and the community.

## Key Decisions & Learning

This session was a deep dive into the nuances of modern frontend tooling configuration.

- **`moduleResolution: "Bundler"` is Key:** Our first investigation, prompted by a GitHub issue, highlighted the importance of setting `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` in `tsconfig.node.json`. This setting is crucial for preventing false-positive type errors in the IDE, as it aligns TypeScript's module-finding strategy with how bundlers like Vite operate. We audited our configuration and confirmed it was already set correctly.

- **Vite Plugin Order Matters:** The official TanStack Router documentation taught us that the router plugin must be initialized *before* the React plugin in `vite.config.ts`. This ensures the route tree is generated before React components are processed, preventing potential build-time race conditions. We corrected our configuration to follow this best practice.

- **API Naming Conventions Evolve:** The final and most critical learning was tracking a new deprecation warning. We discovered that the plugin's exported function had been renamed from `TanStackRouterVite` (PascalCase) to `tanstackRouter` (camelCase). This reflects a common API evolution in JavaScript libraries to better align with naming conventions (functions in camelCase, classes/components in PascalCase).

## Technical Steps Executed

1.  **Context Loading:** The session began by reviewing the log from Day 1 (`session-log-1.md`) and reading external documentation to understand the current state of TanStack Router's Vite integration.
2.  **GitHub Issue Analysis:** We analyzed [TanStack/router#1848](https://github.com/TanStack/router/issues/1848), which pointed us toward the `moduleResolution` setting as a potential source of IDE errors.
3.  **Official Documentation Review:** We consulted the [official installation guide](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/installation-with-vite), which specified the correct plugin order.
4.  **Configuration Audit:**
    - Read [`tsconfig.node.json`](tsconfig.node.json) and confirmed `moduleResolution` was correct.
    - Read [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) and identified the plugin order needed correction.
5.  **Configuration Correction (Plugin Order):** Modified `vite.config.ts` to place the router plugin before the React plugin.
6.  **Final Troubleshooting & Resolution:** After a new deprecation warning appeared, the root cause was identified as a name change in the plugin's API. The user updated [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) with the final fix.
    - **Old:** `import { TanStackRouterVite } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'`
    - **New:** `import { tanstackRouter } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'`

## Final Project State
- **Framework:** React with Vite
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Routing:** TanStack Router using file-based routing.
- **Vite Plugin:** Correctly configured with `tanstackRouter` from `@tanstack/router-plugin`, with the proper plugin order.
- **TypeScript Config:** Confirmed to be using modern and correct module resolution settings.
- **Status:** The development server is running successfully without any errors or warnings. The project's tooling configuration is stable, robust, and aligned with the latest best practices.
