# Session Log: Day 1 - Project Initialization

## Objective
Set up a new React web application using TypeScript, Vite, and TanStack Router, ensuring a modern, stable, and correctly configured development environment.

## Key Decisions & Learning
- **Package Manager:** The project strictly uses `pnpm`. This was enforced by a project rule and corrected after an initial attempt to use `npm`.
- **Router Choice:** After a discussion comparing React Router and TanStack Router, TanStack Router was chosen for its type safety, first-class search parameter handling, and integrated data loading capabilities.
- **Vite Plugin Confusion:** A significant portion of the session was dedicated to resolving a persistent `deprecated` warning for the TanStack Router Vite plugin. Initial attempts based on official documentation were misleading due to a very recent package name change. The issue was resolved by discovering and using the new `@tanstack/router-plugin` package instead of the old `@tanstack/router-vite-plugin`.

## Technical Steps Executed

1.  **Initial Scaffolding (Attempt 1 - Failed)**
    - **Command:** `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`
    - **Result:** Denied by user, who enforced the `pnpm` project rule.

2.  **Initial Scaffolding (Attempt 2 - Success)**
    - **Command:** `pnpm create vite . --template react-ts`
    - **Result:** Successfully scaffolded the base Vite + React + TS project.

3.  **Dependency Installation**
    - **Command:** `pnpm install`
    - **Result:** Base dependencies installed.

4.  **Add TanStack Router**
    - **Command:** `pnpm add @tanstack/react-router`
    - **Result:** Successfully added the core router package.

5.  **Add Vite Plugin (Attempt 1 - Deprecated)**
    - **Command:** `pnpm add -D @tanstack/router-vite-plugin`
    - **Action:** Modified `vite.config.ts` to use `TanStackRouterVite` from this package.
    - **Result:** A persistent deprecation warning (`TS6385`) was reported by the IDE, indicating this was not the correct long-term solution.

6.  **File-Based Routing Setup**
    - Created `src/routes/__root.tsx` to define the main application layout.
    - Created `src/routes/index.tsx` for the home page.
    - Created `src/routes/about.tsx` for the about page.
    - Corrected an initial error where the path was incorrectly passed to `createFileRoute()`. The file-based router infers the path from the file's location.

7.  **Main Application Entry Point**
    - Modified `src/main.tsx` to:
        - Import the auto-generated `routeTree` from `./routeTree.gen`.
        - Create a router instance with `createRouter({ routeTree })`.
        - Register the router type globally for full type safety.
        - Render the `<RouterProvider />`.

8.  **Troubleshooting the Vite Plugin**
    - **Action:** Ran `pnpm run dev`.
    - **Result:** The app worked, but the deprecation warning in `vite.config.ts` remained.
    - **Investigation:** Performed web searches to understand the deprecation. Discovered that the plugin had been renamed and moved.
    - **Resolution Step 1:** Installed the new plugin with `pnpm add -D @tanstack/router-plugin`.
    - **Resolution Step 2:** Updated `vite.config.ts` to import from the new package: `import { TanStackRouterVite } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'`.
    - **Resolution Step 3:** Confirmed the server restarted without warnings.
    - **Resolution Step 4:** Cleaned up the old dependency with `pnpm remove @tanstack/router-vite-plugin`.

## Final Project State
- **Framework:** React with Vite
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Routing:** TanStack Router using file-based routing.
- **Vite Plugin:** Correctly configured with `@tanstack/router-plugin`.
- **Dependencies:** All necessary packages are installed, and unused ones are removed.
- **Status:** The development server is running successfully without errors or warnings. The project is stable and ready for feature development.
